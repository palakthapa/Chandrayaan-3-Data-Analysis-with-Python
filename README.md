# Chandrayaan 3 Data Analysis
__Project Overview__
This project presents a detailed analysis of Chandrayaan 3 mission data obtained from ISRO's website. The primary objectives of this analysis were to:

Extract critical information regarding component mass and power requirements from ISRO's data.
Utilize Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Plotly, and Regular Expressions, to process and analyze the data.
Present insights and visualizations to better understand the mission's technical aspects.
The project's goal is to gain valuable insights into the Chandrayaan 3 mission's technical specifications.

__Data Source__
The data for this analysis was sourced directly from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) website, where detailed information about the Chandrayaan 3 mission, including component mass and power requirements, was made available.

__Analysis Tools__
The analysis involved the use of various Python libraries:

NumPy: Utilized for numerical operations and data manipulation.
Pandas: Employed for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
Math Library: Applied for mathematical analysis and modeling.
Plotly: Used to create interactive and informative visualizations.
Regular Expressions: Applied to extract specific numeric values from textual data.

__Analysis Steps__
The analysis followed these key steps:

1.Data Extraction: Data was scraped from ISRO's website, capturing information relevant to component mass and power requirements.

2.Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, including handling missing values and data type conversions, was performed to prepare the dataset for analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data was analyzed using NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly to generate interactive visualizations and gain insights.
